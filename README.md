Superstore, a fictional retail entity in the U.S., specializes in furniture, office supplies, and technology products. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the company's performance from 2019 to 2022, highlighting key areas of strength and potential opportunities for growth.

# EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW:
Superstore is a fictional retail company based in the United States. They specialize in selling furniture, office supplies, and technology products. This summer, they hired me as a Business Intelligence Analyst at their Seattle office. My role is to identify weaknesses and opportunities within their business, and my goal is to help them enhance their business growth and profitability.

# Business Questions:
* Which states and cities are generating the highest revenue?
* Which product category is both the best-selling and the most profitable?
* Which product sub-categories and specific products are top performers as well as those that are underperforming?
* Are there products that are frequently bought together?
* Which customer segment is bringing in the most profit?
* What is the most preferred shipping mode among our customers?
* How has the company's performance trended over recent months?
* What are the KPIs?

# DATASET:
The original dataset was obtained from the HiCounselor website. It contains 9993 sales transactions that occurred from 2019 to 2022. This dataset encompasses a wide range of information, including order specifics, geographical data, and product-related data. There are no missing values or any irrelevant data types and values. During the inspection process, a duplicate entry was identified and removed for accuracy. For those who are interested in viewing or downloading the refined dataset, it is available in my GitHub repository.

# KPIs:
Over the past four years, Superstore generated $2.3 million in revenue but only had a gross profit of $286.41K. The company's average discount stood at 15.62%, suggesting that the discounting strategy might have influenced the profit margin. A detailed breakdown of the profit margin within the discount category will be explored later in the Financial Analysis dashboard.
* Sales by Region and state:
The West region boasted the highest revenue, with sales amounting to $725K, followed by the East region with sales of $678K. Within those two regions, California, Washington, and New York were the top states that contributed the most revenue to the company. Therefore, the company should focus on marketing efforts and optimizing inventory in those states to further increase sales.

The Central region with sales of $501K, and the South with sales of $392K, represented two regions that might have had untapped potential worth exploring.

# Sales vs. Profit by Category and Sub-Category:
The Technology category emerged as the leading performer in both sales and profit. Within this category, the Phones sub-category stood out with impressive sales and profit figures. On the other hand, the Furniture category showcased significant sales but had a notably lower profit margin. Within the Furniture category, the Tables displayed decent sales but operated at a loss. Additionally, both Bookcases and Supplies resulted in a negative profit for the company. These observations raise concerns, suggesting potential issues with the cost structure or pricing strategy, especially for the Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies subcategories.
# Customer Segments and Preferences
* Orders by Customer Segment: The Consumer segment was the largest customer base. Superstore should create tailored marketing campaigns targeting this segment to increase sales. The Corporate and Home Office segments with smaller customer bases, present growth opportunities with focused B2B strategies.
* Orders by Shipping Preferences: Most customers preferred Standard Class shipping, indicating that they might prioritize cost savings over faster delivery.
* Top Three Customers by Order: Raymond Buch, Sean Miler, and Tamara Chand were the most frequent shoppers with a max of 6 orders for the past 4 years. This pattern suggests a potential gap in customer loyalty. To address this, Superstore could introduce exclusive offers and a loyalty program, adjust pricing for regular customers, and actively seek their feedback to refine the shopping experience. Engaging customers through educational content on social media, newsletters, and tailored content for different segments could further foster loyalty and retention.
